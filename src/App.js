            <p >In order to study any language, you first must start with learning the foundation that
              is the target language's alphabet. I created this app with that goal in mind. As someone who is
              fascinated with Japanese culture, I have taken up an interest in learning the language. That's when I came
              to learn Japanese kind of has three alphabet's, or three different writing systems, that work together as a whole.
              </p>
              <p >
              In this app I am focused on learning Hiragana and Katakana (because kanji is a different beast) by having 
              character tables to refernece, index-like cards to study and finally a quiz to see how many characters can be 
              correctly recalled. I wanted to create an app that I found easy to use, simple and straightforward at what it's
              trying to achieve, and all while being an enjoyable user experience.
