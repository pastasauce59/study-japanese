This is an app I wanted to create to help me begin learning the Japanese language. With any language you must first know its alphabet. This app aims to help study the Japanese syllabaries of hiragana and katakana (as kanji is a whole different ball). The app will have a character table section to view all characters, a study section where you can view single characters and 'flip' them over like index cards, and a quiz section where you can then quiz yourself and see how many characters you get right. I plan to implement a backend so users can create an account. The benefit of having an account is to be able to persist all your wrong answers from quizing and to a separate list so you can choose to study the tough characters that you only got incorrect and really commit them to memory.
